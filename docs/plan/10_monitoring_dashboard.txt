TASK 10: Monitoring and Dashboard
==================================

PRIORITY: Medium
STATUS: Pending
DEPENDENCIES: Task 08, Task 09

DESCRIPTION:
Build real-time monitoring for the trading system with alerts
and performance tracking.

MONITORING COMPONENTS:

1. Market Scanner Status:
   - Markets being monitored
   - Last scan timestamp
   - Opportunities detected
   - Opportunities executed

2. Position Monitor:
   - Current positions
   - P&L per position
   - Time to expiration
   - Risk metrics per position

3. Risk Dashboard:
   - Current drawdown
   - Cluster exposures
   - Correlation changes
   - CVaR estimates

4. Execution Log:
   - Orders placed
   - Fill status
   - Slippage analysis
   - Fee tracking

5. Alert System:
   - Drawdown threshold breached
   - Correlation spike detected
   - Large opportunity found
   - Execution failure

DELIVERABLES:

1. Monitor class:
   - start_monitoring() -> async
   - get_status() -> SystemStatus
   - get_positions() -> List[Position]
   - get_pnl() -> PnLReport
   - get_risk_metrics() -> RiskMetrics

2. AlertManager class:
   - register_alert(condition, action)
   - check_alerts() -> List[Alert]
   - send_notification(alert)

3. Logging:
   - Structured logging (JSON format)
   - Log rotation
   - Separate logs for: trades, errors, signals, risk

4. Performance tracking:
   - Daily P&L
   - Win rate
   - Average edge captured
   - Sharpe ratio (if applicable)

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- [ ] Real-time position tracking
- [ ] P&L calculation correct
- [ ] Alert system working
- [ ] Logging comprehensive
- [ ] Performance metrics accurate

NOTES:
- Keep monitoring lightweight (don't impact trading latency)
- Store historical data for backtesting
- Consider simple CLI dashboard initially (no web UI needed)
