KALSHI STATIC ARBITRAGE TRADING SYSTEM
======================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
A trading system that exploits logical constraint violations in Kalshi
prediction markets. The core insight: you're not predicting outcomes,
you're trading incoherence.

CORE IDEA:
Use logical arbitrage constraints to define no-loss probability bounds,
then take directional positions only when market prices violate those
bounds by a margin larger than fees and execution risk.

WHY THIS HAS REAL ALPHA:
- Bounds are absolute, not statistical
- Market cannot resolve without respecting them
- Fees do not eliminate large logical gaps
- Competition focuses on pure arb, not "almost arb"
- Scales with confidence, not liquidity gaps
