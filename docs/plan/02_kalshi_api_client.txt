TASK 02: Kalshi API Client
==========================

PRIORITY: High
STATUS: Pending
DEPENDENCIES: Task 01

DESCRIPTION:
Build a robust API client for Kalshi market data and trading operations.

DELIVERABLES:
1. KalshiClient class with methods:
   - get_markets() - List all markets
   - get_market(ticker) - Single market details
   - get_orderbook(ticker) - Current bid/ask state
   - get_series(series_ticker) - Series metadata
   - get_candlesticks(ticker) - OHLC data

2. Authentication handling for trading endpoints:
   - login()
   - place_order()
   - cancel_order()
   - get_positions()
   - get_balance()

3. Rate limiting and caching:
   - Request throttling (respect API limits)
   - Response caching (10-30s TTL)
   - Automatic retry with backoff

ENDPOINTS:
- Base URL: https://api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2
- GET /markets - List markets
- GET /markets/{ticker} - Market details
- GET /markets/{ticker}/orderbook - Order book
- GET /series/{series_ticker} - Series info

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- [ ] All public endpoints implemented
- [ ] Authentication flow working
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents API bans
- [ ] Caching reduces redundant calls
- [ ] Error handling for network issues
- [ ] Async support for concurrent requests

NOTES:
- Market data is public (no auth required)
- Trading requires API key authentication
- Order book only returns YES bids (NO derived as 100-price)
